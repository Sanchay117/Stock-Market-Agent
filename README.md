# AI Stock Market Agent

A FastAPI-based stock market assistant that fetches real-time stock information, the latest market news, and provides AI-powered buy/sell/hold recommendations.

## Features

- Fetches the latest stock market prices for the requested ticker/stock using the Finnhub API.
- Provides AI-based stock recommendations using LangChain and various LLM models through the HuggingFace API.
- RESTful API endpoints to fetch data and AI analysis.
- Integrates with DuckDuckGo for the latest news.

## Project Structure

```
app/
   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py               # FastAPI server
   â”œâ”€â”€ stock_fetcher.py      # Fetches real-time stock info and news
   â”œâ”€â”€ langchain_agent.py    # Integrates with LangChain and Hugging Face for AI recommendations
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

## Limitations

The project can only list US based stocks right now as the free tier of the finnhub(API I am using) doesn't support other stocks.

Also YahooFinance was only allowing me like 5 queries an hour making development extremely difficult because of which I had to go with the Finnhub API. 

## âœ… Deployed
The project is live!

## Setup Locally

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-project-directory>/app
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set environment variables

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here
   ```

   Alternatively, export them directly in the shell:

   export FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   export HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here
   ```
